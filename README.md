# Prometheus Alertmanager Discord Bot

This Discord Bot receives alerts triggered by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and its
[Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) and translates them into
Discord messages which are then sent by a bot. The bot needs to be hosted in an OCI-compliant 
environment

> WARNING: This bot is currently under heavy development and not production ready
